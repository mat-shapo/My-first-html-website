        <p >Peepo, also known as <span style="color: red;">Pepe</span>, is a series of various emotes on Discord and Twitch depicting poorly drawn
            versions of
            Pepe the Frog, sharing similarities to Apu Apustaja (or "Help Helper" in English). The emotes are typically
            used
            in chats on both platforms to express a number of emotions depending on the type of Peepo used, ranging from
            happy to sad or more situational depending on the context. Hypers are also types of Peepos, often used
            within
            specific communities, such as GreekGodX. The first Peepo variations date back to at least 2017.
